The `loadflux` package is build for the comprehensive analysis of the intra-event suspended sediment dynamics.

## Installation

<!-- CRAN
You can install the released version of loadflux from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("loadflux")
```
 -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/atsyplenkov/loadflux/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("atsyplenkov/loadflux")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to split your series into hydrological events:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(loadflux)
data(djan)

df <- djan %>% 
  hydro_events(q = discharge,
               datetime = time,
               window = 21)

head(df)
```

### Plots

Then you can  plot the hysteresis loop by running `hysteresis_plot`

```{r hysteresis_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

df %>% 
  filter(he == 2) %>%
  hysteresis_plot(q = discharge,
                  ssc = SS,
                  base_font_size = 14)
```

### Hyseteresis indexes

This package also contains several function for hysteresis index calculation:

**Added**

- `SHI` - Simple Hystersis Index from [*Tsyplenkov et al., 2020*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-020-02633-z/)
- `AHI` - Aich's Hysteresis Index from [*Aich et al., 2014*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0341816214001969/)

**Pending**

- `HImid` - Hysteresis Index from [*Lawler et al., 2006*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969705005711/)

To calculate a hysteresis index for your event run as follows:

```{r shi, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df %>% 
  filter(he == 2) %>% 
  SHI(q = discharge,
      ssc = SS)

```
